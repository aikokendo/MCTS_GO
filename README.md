# MCTS_GO

## Mid-term Project Description

Implement a computer program that uses MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) to play a five-in-a-line in a Go-game board of 15 by 15. (The true GO game board is 19 by 19)

A five-in-a-line GO game winner is the one who can “firstly” play the stones (Black or White) in a connected line either horizontal or vertical or diagonal in the Go-game board.

We assume Black play first, and white play the second. So you should allow the program to play either in black stone or the white stone. We also would only the program to spend no more than 10 seconds to play a move. So you should control your MCTS computation resource to explore the space within the time limit. You should consider the “quality score” of a “win”,” tie”, “loose” of a game for backpropragation to a selection node and balance parameters between the exploration and exploitation.
